# Rollway

Lets say you have a log of Scuttlebutt messages, and you want to group related messages into unified items in a feed, then Rollway provides a way to do that in a configurable and presentation agnostic way.

## Status

This is currently vapourware, not working code.

## Roadmap

### 1. Learn and Prototype

- [X] See what it's like to process the entire scuttlebutt log into a flume view.
- [ ] Collect the roots
- [ ] Order the roots based on latest message received
